# Python Calculator & Greeting Program

This repository contains two simple Python programs:

---

## 🔢 1. Basic Arithmetic Operations

This program takes two integers as input from the user and performs the following operations:

* **Addition**
* **Subtraction**
* **Multiplication**
* **Division** (with zero-division error handling)

### 🧪 Example:

```bash
Enter first number: 10  
Enter second number: 5  
Addition: 15  
Subtraction: 5  
Multiplication: 50  
Division: 2.0  
```

---

## 🙋‍♂️ 2. Greeting Program

This program takes the user's first and last name as input and prints a personalized greeting.

### 🧪 Example:

```bash
Enter your first name: John  
Enter your last name: Doe  
Hello, John Doe! Welcome to the Python program.
```

---

## 💡 How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Run the script using:

```bash
python filename.py
```

Replace `filename.py` with the name of your Python script file.

Let me know if you also want this split into two separate `.py` files or combined with input prompts grouped more cleanly!
